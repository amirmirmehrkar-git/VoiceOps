## 🎯 Recommendations

### Option 1: Update Expanded Package (Recommended)
**Action**: Copy complete files from main project to Expanded package
**Use Case**: When you need a complete ZIP package with all details

### Option 2: Keep Both Versions
**Action**: Keep Expanded as minimal versions, main as complete versions
**Use Case**: When you need quick reference vs. detailed documentation

### Option 3: Remove Expanded Package
**Action**: Delete Expanded package, use main project files only
**Use Case**: If Expanded package is redundant

# VoiceOps Sales Outreach Scripts

## Cold Outreach (Email)

**Subject**: Reduce incident response time by 90%

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] handles [X] incidents per month. What if your team could report incidents via voice and have tickets automatically created in Jira/PagerDuty?

VoiceOps converts voice reports into production-ready incidents in 90 seconds—no manual data entry, no errors, no delays.

**The result**: 90% faster incident response, 100% accurate ticket creation.

Would you be open to a 15-minute demo?

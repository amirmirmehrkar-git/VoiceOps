# VoiceOps ROI Calculator

## Quick ROI Calculation

### Inputs
- **Incidents per month**: [X]
- **Current time per incident**: [Y] minutes
- **Hourly rate**: $[Z]/hour
- **VoiceOps time per incident**: 90 seconds (1.5 minutes)
- **VoiceOps cost**: $[A]/month

### Calculation

**Time Saved per Incident**:
= Current time - VoiceOps time
= [Y] minutes - 1.5 minutes
= [Y-1.5] minutes

**Monthly Time Savings**:
= Time saved × Incidents
= [Y-1.5] minutes × [X] incidents
= [B] minutes
= [C] hours

**Monthly Value Created**:
= Hours saved × Hourly rate
= [C] hours × $[Z]/hour
= $[D]/month

**ROI**:
= (Value created - Cost) / Cost
= ($[D] - $[A]) / $[A]
= [E]x return

**Payback Period**:
= Cost / Monthly value
= $[A] / $[D]
= [F] months

## Example Calculation

**Inputs**:
- Incidents: 100/month
- Current time: 10 minutes/incident
- Hourly rate: $50/hour
- VoiceOps cost: $200/month

**Calculation**:
- Time saved: 10 - 1.5 = 8.5 minutes/incident
- Monthly savings: 8.5 × 100 = 850 minutes = 14.2 hours
- Value created: 14.2 × $50 = $710/month
- ROI: ($710 - $200) / $200 = 2.55x
- Payback: $200 / $710 = 0.28 months (8.5 days)

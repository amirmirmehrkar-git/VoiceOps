# VoiceOps Objection Handling

## Pricing Objections

### "It's too expensive"
**Response**: 
"Let's calculate ROI. If your team handles 100 incidents/month and saves 10 minutes per incident, that's 16+ hours saved. At $X/hour, that's $Y/month in value—far more than our $Z/month cost. Plus, faster response means less downtime. Want to run the numbers together?"

### "We need budget approval"
**Response**:
"Understood. Let's start with a free pilot. No commitment, no payment. After 2-3 weeks, you'll have real data to show ROI. Then we can discuss budget. Sound good?"

## AI/Technology Objections

### "AI isn't reliable enough"
**Response**:
"VoiceOps uses deterministic severity rules, not just AI. Every incident is schema-validated. We've processed [X] incidents with [Y]% accuracy. Plus, you can review before webhook delivery. Want to see the validation process?"

### "We already have forms"
**Response**:
"Forms work, but they're slow. VoiceOps is 10x faster—90 seconds vs 10 minutes. And during an outage, your team can call while running to fix the issue. Forms require stopping everything. Which would you prefer during a critical incident?"

## Integration Objections

### "We use different tools"
**Response**:
"VoiceOps supports webhooks to any system. We have pre-built integrations for Jira and PagerDuty, but we can integrate with [their tool] via webhook. What system do you use?"

### "Our Jira setup is complex"
**Response**:
"We can work with your Jira admin to configure the integration. It's usually just setting up a webhook URL and API key. We've integrated with complex Jira setups before. Want to schedule a technical call?"

## Security/Compliance Objections

### "We need SOC2"
**Response**:
"We follow SOC2-lite controls and are on track for full SOC2 Type II by Q2 2025. We can share our control documentation. For enterprise customers, we can accelerate the timeline. What's your timeline?"

### "We're in healthcare"
**Response**:
"VoiceOps can be configured for HIPAA-aligned use cases. We offer BAAs and can ensure no PHI is processed. We've worked with healthcare customers before. Want to discuss your specific requirements?"

---

## Timing Objections

### "Not the right time"
**Response**:
"Understood. When would be a better time? In the meantime, a free pilot has no commitment. You can evaluate now and implement when ready. Or I can follow up in [timeframe]. What works?"

### "We're too busy"
**Response**:
"That's exactly why VoiceOps helps. It saves time. A 15-minute demo could save hours per week. Worth 15 minutes?"

## General Objections

### "We need to think about it"
**Response**:
"Of course. What specific concerns do you have? I can address them now, or we can schedule a follow-up. Also, a free pilot lets you evaluate risk-free. Interested?"

### "Send me information"
**Response**:
"Absolutely. I'll send:
- Product overview
- Security FAQ
- ROI calculator
- Demo video

When would be a good time to follow up?"

## Closing Techniques

1. **Assumptive Close**: "Great, let's get you set up with a pilot. When can you start?"
2. **Alternative Close**: "Would you prefer Team plan or Regulated plan?"
3. **Urgency Close**: "Pilot spots are limited this month. Want to reserve one?"
4. **Summary Close**: "So we've covered X, Y, Z. Ready to move forward?"

# Founder Closing Scripts

## For Enterprise Deals

### When Deal is Stuck

**Script 1: Executive Escalation**
"Hi [Executive Name],

I wanted to reach out directly. We've been working with [Contact] on VoiceOps, and I sense we're close but something's holding things up.

**The ask**: 15 minutes of your time to understand what's blocking the decision.

**Why it matters**: VoiceOps can save your team [X] hours/month and reduce incident response time by 90%. That's [Y] in value.

**Next step**: Quick call this week?

Best,
[Your Name]"

### When Price is Objection

**Script 2: Value Reframe**
"Hi [Name],

I understand the price concern. Let me reframe:

**Current cost**: $X/month
**Value created**: $Y/month (based on [Z] hours saved)
**Net ROI**: [A]x return

**Alternative**: We can start with a pilot (free) to prove ROI, then convert to paid plan.

**Or**: We can customize pricing based on your specific needs.

What works better for you?"

### When Timeline is Issue

**Script 3: Urgency Without Pressure**
"Hi [Name],

I know you're busy. Here's why VoiceOps matters now:

**Current pain**: [X] minutes per incident × [Y] incidents = [Z] hours/month lost
**With VoiceOps**: 90 seconds per incident = [A] hours saved

**The cost of waiting**: Every month you wait, you lose [B] hours.

**The solution**: Free pilot starts immediately. No commitment. Real ROI in 2-3 weeks.

Worth 15 minutes to discuss?"

## For Pilot Conversions

### When Pilot Ends, No Decision

**Script 4: Pilot Results Close**
"Hi [Name],

Your pilot just ended. Results:

- ✅ [X] incidents processed
- ✅ [Y]% time savings
- ✅ [Z]% accuracy improvement
- ✅ [A]% team adoption

**ROI**: [B]x return on investment.

**Next step**: Convert to paid plan? Or extend pilot?

I'm here to help make this work. What do you need?"

---

### When They Need More Time

**Script 5: Gentle Nudge**
"Hi [Name],

Following up on VoiceOps pilot. I know you're evaluating.

**Question**: What specific concerns do you have? I can address them now.

**Or**: We can extend the pilot (no commitment) so you have more time.

**Goal**: Make this work for you. What do you need?"

## Objection Responses
